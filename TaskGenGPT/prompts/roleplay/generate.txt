### Task Generation

Given who you are and how you're feeling right now, imagine that you are in a real room with several items in it. You need to think of ways to pass the time that feel natural to your personal profile and current state. We have provided a list of items, where each entry is a tuple containing the item or person and its quantity. If there is one other person in the room, this will be noted as ('Other people', 1).

The following is the list of items available in the room, in the format (item, quantity):
{{ scene }}

Based on your personality and the available items, please imagine {{ num_tasks }} tasks (daily activities or games) that you would naturally choose to do.

#### Task Report

Structure each task report as follows:
**Task Name**: *Please give your task a short name. Note: The task name should be fewer than 6 words.*
**Required Items**: Select all necessary items and their specific quantities from the items list.
**Task Description**: Please briefly describe the task.
**Detailed Task Setup**: Please describe how the items are arranged and interacted with in the task.
**Task Goal**: Please describe the goal of the task
**Scoring System**: Please describe the scoring method.

Please think step by step and give your reasons before generating the task report.
