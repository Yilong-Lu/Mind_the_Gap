Please note the following:
1. **Your task must be able to be completed in a room, without needing extra space.**
2. **You cannot use items or people that are not on the list.**
    + Do not creat a multi-person task if there are no **other people** in the scenario.
3. **Each task must have a scoring system.**
4. **Use at least one item from the list.**

After creating the task, we will ask you a few questions and some brief follow-up questions before the experiment ends.

To ensure you understand the experiment setup, you will need to answer several questions about the setup before the official start.
